# nosql-challenge
Module 12 Challenge
This challenge is called a NoSQL Challenge and utilizes MongoDB to load a data collection. My tutor, Anna Poulakos, helped me to download a Docker Desktop, so my data was loaded slightly different into the Jupyter Notebook, but it was able to be loaded for set up and analysis for this project.
After the collection and database was loaded, I added in a new business to the database along with the ID and Type. Establishments at a certain location of 'Dover' were removed, and latitude, longitude, and the Rating Value were all changed to numbers in place of Strings.
In the Exploratory Analysis Notebook, Rating Numbers were kept in order to search for higher-rated restaurants. It was noted that while higher ratings (1-5) are better for the RatingValue, but that higher values for Hygiene, Structural, and Confidence in Management work in reverse and are actually worse ratings if the value is higher.
This notebook answers questions for the worst and best hygiene ratings, establishments in London that have a rating value greater than or equal to 4, and the top 5 establishments near the newest restaurant added, "Penang Flavours".
I received tutoring from Anna Poulakos to get the database loaded, and I utilized suggestions and starter code shared from Alexander Booth.
